# Multi-Robot Formation Control with Differential-Drive Robots

A tutorial on multi-robot formation control using **HamsterS differential-drive robots**, an overhead camera, and **ArUco markers**. The implementation tracks robot poses with OpenCV, computes formation-control vectors from relative positions, and converts those vectors into wheel commands.

The complete instructions, code explanations, and demonstrations are available in the **[full tutorial](TUTORIAL.md)**.

## Objectives

This tutorial introduces how to:

- Detect and track multiple robots using ArUco markers and an overhead camera.
- Define a circular formation using desired relative displacement vectors.
- Calculate formation errors and control vectors for each robot.
- Convert control vectors into differential-drive wheel commands.
- Integrate robot localization, formation control, and reactive obstacle avoidance.

## Requirements

- Two or more HamsterS robots
- An overhead USB camera and one ArUco marker per robot
- Python 3.10 or newer
- NumPy, OpenCV (ArUco), and RoboID

Install the Python dependencies:

```bash
python -m pip install numpy opencv-contrib-python roboid
```

For setup details and controller parameters, see [Hardware](TUTORIAL.md#3-hardware) and [Software Requirements](TUTORIAL.md#4-software-requirements).

## Demonstration

The tutorial demonstrates physical robots moving toward a circular formation and using proximity sensors for basic obstacle avoidance.

See the [real-robot demonstration](TUTORIAL.md#real-robot-demonstration) and [reactive obstacle avoidance](TUTORIAL.md#reactive-obstacle-avoidance) sections.

## Summary

The tutorial combines overhead camera-based localization, pairwise formation control, and differential-drive actuation in a simple multi-robot system. See the [full tutorial summary](TUTORIAL.md#13-summary).
